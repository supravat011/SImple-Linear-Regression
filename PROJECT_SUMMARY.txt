SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION FOR SALARY PREDICTION - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================================

TITLE:
------
Predictive Salary Estimation System Using Simple Linear Regression: 
A Machine Learning Approach to Experience-Based Compensation Analysis

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
---------
This project implements a machine learning-based salary prediction system using 
Simple Linear Regression to establish a quantitative relationship between years 
of professional experience and salary compensation. Built with Python's 
scientific ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), the model 
trains on 30 employee records using a 67-33 train-test split methodology. 
The system provides data-driven insights for HR departments, job seekers, and 
recruitment agencies through visual representations and predictive analytics.

Keywords: Linear Regression, Salary Prediction, Machine Learning, Scikit-learn, 
          Data Visualization, HR Analytics
